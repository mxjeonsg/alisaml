## AlisaML

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxjeonsg/cloud/main/alisaml/meow.png" width=80 height=80>

**An dumb attempt to make a GUI with [raylib](https://raylib.com) making a**
**XML subset in the process**


## Building and running

* A bit of cloning
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/mxjeonsg/alisaml
```
* Open da folder and set everything up
``` bash
cd alisaml; mkdir build
```
* Compile
``` bash
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles " . && make
```
* And give it a try
``` bash
./Alisaml
```


## Help?

If you found a bug, feel free to open an issue.
(Considering my WIDE skill issues for everything,
 please try to be as specific as you can, providing
 an example of how to replicate the unexpected
 behaviour.)

And if you want to provide any suggestion, solution or
insight in general, fell free to open issues too.
Maybe I get to learn something for more people than me. :D
